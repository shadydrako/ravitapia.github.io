## Welcome to my website!

# Who am I
My name is Ravi Tapia, and I am currently a 2nd year Computer Science Major at UCSD. This is where I will be putting most of my projects such as _Flirty Bot_ and future ideas. 

## Why Computer Science? 

I chose computer science because ever since I was child I have been interested in programs through my love of games. I always wanted to create my own games
and create something that would benefit the world or bring joy it. Everytime one of my projects is able to work or my print statements like `Hello world` works, I was filled with joy.  

### Langauges
1. C++
2. Java
3. Javascript

I am new to github so please **bare with me**.

Please follow me on [Instragram](https://www.instagram.com/rravi.tpia/) for other questions or just to be friends!

**Flirty Bot** was a discord bot I made during summer as a little side project. It interacts with users, gives them words of affirmations, and in other cases pick up lines, hence the name flirty bot. It is a work in progress and I plan to make it do much more!
